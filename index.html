          On Saturday 3 October 2020, a video showing a SARS police officer
          shooting a young Nigerian in front of Wetland Hotel, Ughelli, Delta
          State trended on the Internet. It was alleged that the police officers
          took away the young man's vehicle â€“ a Lexus SUV.[36] The trending
          video caused public outcry on social media, especially on Twitter,
          with the #ENDSARS hashtag trending.

          Just as the ENDSARS trend began on Twitter, on Monday 5 October 2020,
          another report surfaced of SARS officers killing a 20-year-old
          upcoming musician named Daniel Chibuike, popularly called Sleek in his
          neighbourhood. Sleek was said to be sitting in front of a hotel with a
          friend when the SARS officers approached them, prompting them to flee.
          According to an eyewitness, the SARS men pursued the pair, shouting
          "thief", before shooting Sleek as they ran through a supermarket. His
          friend was arrested.

          On Thursday 8 October 2020, nationwide protests on ENDSARS started
          after weeks of outrage and anger with videos and pictures showing
          police brutality, harassment and extortion in Nigeria. The protests
          were led predominantly by young Nigerians in different cities
          alongside many activists and celebrities.Nigeria Police Force
          disrupted the protests in some cities, throwing teargas, using water
          cannons and shooting at unarmed peaceful protesters as seen in Abuja
          and Osun. This led to the death of Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso, Oyo State.
          By Wednesday, 14 October 2020, the End SARS protests were still
          on-going with young people in different parts of Nigeria intensifying
          their calls for reforms and accountability in police operations.[45]
