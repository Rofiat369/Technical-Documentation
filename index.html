          On Saturday 3 October 2020, a video showing a SARS police officer
          shooting a young Nigerian in front of Wetland Hotel, Ughelli, Delta
          State trended on the Internet. It was alleged that the police officers
          took away the young man's vehicle â€“ a Lexus SUV.[36] The trending
          video caused public outcry on social media, especially on Twitter,
          with the #ENDSARS hashtag trending.

          Just as the ENDSARS trend began on Twitter, on Monday 5 October 2020,
          another report surfaced of SARS officers killing a 20-year-old
          upcoming musician named Daniel Chibuike, popularly called Sleek in his
          neighbourhood. Sleek was said to be sitting in front of a hotel with a
          friend when the SARS officers approached them, prompting them to flee.
          According to an eyewitness, the SARS men pursued the pair, shouting
          "thief", before shooting Sleek as they ran through a supermarket. His
          friend was arrested.

          On Thursday 8 October 2020, nationwide protests on ENDSARS started
          after weeks of outrage and anger with videos and pictures showing
          police brutality, harassment and extortion in Nigeria. The protests
          were led predominantly by young Nigerians in different cities
          alongside many activists and celebrities.Nigeria Police Force
          disrupted the protests in some cities, throwing teargas, using water
          cannons and shooting at unarmed peaceful protesters as seen in Abuja
          and Osun. This led to the death of Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso, Oyo State.
          By Wednesday, 14 October 2020, the End SARS protests were still
          on-going with young people in different parts of Nigeria intensifying
          their calls for reforms and accountability in police operations.[45]
          On October 20 the Nigerian Army murdered protesters at the Lekki
          tollgate

          Amnesty International accused the SARS officials of regularly
          detaining young male Nigerians illegally and extorting money from
          their relatives. In 2016, a human rights activist, Segun Awosanya
          popularly known as Segalink started EndSARS campaign on Twitter
          prompting police authority to announce reform of the police unit but
          nothing was achieved at the time. In 2018, Nigerian rapper Michael
          Ugochukwu Stephens professionally known Ruggedman joined the campaign
          to end police brutality by releasing a single titled, Is Police Your
          Friend? In 2017, a petition signed by 10,195 people was submitted to
          Nigeria's National Assembly calling for a total disbandment of SARS. A
          few Senators backed the call for total disbandment of the unit.
          Consideration was given to reforming the force, rather than full
          disbandment due to the number of cases falling.

          The campaigners moved from social media using the #EndSARS hashtag to
          organised, peaceful protests in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan, Osun, Benin,
          Ughelli, Warri, Ilorin, Ogbomosho, Owerri, Jos, Kaduna, Calabar and
          other Nigerian cities and states, threatening to continue if the
          government refused to disband the force. Not only were there
          campaigners in Nigeria utilising the hashtag and having protests but
          they were also done in London and some parts of America recognising
          this situation as a global event. In response to the campaign, Nigeria
          Police Force Public Relations Officer Jimoh Moshood accused the
          campaigners of being "criminals". Despite this, Inspector General of
          Nigeria Police Force Ibrahim K. Idris ordered the reform and
          reorganisation of SARS.
